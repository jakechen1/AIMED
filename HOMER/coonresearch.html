			  <p class="content"><strong>Elucidation of the cellular signaling  pathways that commit hES cells to exit the pluripotent state.&nbsp; </strong>Here we use our novel PTM-friendly sequencing  technologies to reveal the phosphorylation cascades that set the irreversible  differentiation process in motion.&nbsp; To  date we have identified 3,819 unique sites of protein phosphorylation from human  ES cells. &nbsp;We have now begun to carefully  monitor these sites to determine which branches of the FGF signaling pathway  are active in human ES cells and which proteins/networks are phosphorylated in  response to TPA.&nbsp; This work is funded  through a private donation with co-investigator J. Thomson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br />

			  <p class="content"><strong>Sequential ion/ion reactions for large  peptide and whole protein sequence analysis. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This project aims to develop a  suite of ion/ion reaction chemistries, and to automate their use in a novel MS  system.&nbsp; This work is funded by the NIH  (RO1 GM080148) and by Thermo Fisher Scientific through a sponsored research  agreement.&nbsp; <br />

			  <p class="content"><strong>Gas-phase coordination chemistry for rapid, robust  whole protein sequencing.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project seeks to develop small  molecule anions that covalently bind to selected sites of a gas-phase protein  cation (e.g., selected amino acids).&nbsp; The  bound anionic reagents will then serve as scaffolds to harbor site-specific  cleavage, with enzyme-like specificity.&nbsp;  This project has been funded by the Beckman Young Investigator Program. <br />

			  <p class="content"><strong>The development of novel computational algorithms for  protein sequence identification.&nbsp; </strong>Here we aim to develop new algorithms to determine the  sequence of a peptide or protein directly from a tandem mass spectrum.&nbsp; This work is performed jointly with  Mathematics Professor Gheorghe Craciun.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
